# Go Development

Go reminds me on the good old days of C programming centuries (;) ago. It shares all of the good parts and removes most (all?) of the bad ones.

### Why Go?

Well, decide yourself:

  * strongly typed
  * simplified and easy-to-read syntax
  * fixed style (via gofmt)
  * pointers, but no pointer arithmetic
  * garbage collected
  * compiles to native code (fast at runtime)
  * easy to use toolchain (even for crossplatform building)
  * can compile to single binaries without any dependencies (great for minimalistic docker images)
  * no declaration of interfaces necessary (just implement the required methods / duck typing)
  * great tooling and docs
  * functions can return more than one value (think of result + errorcode)

That are just a few of it's virtues. No wonder why so many project like Docker using Go ...
